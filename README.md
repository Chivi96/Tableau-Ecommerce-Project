### **Case Study: Enhancing E-Commerce Strategies through Data Analytics**

### **Background**

As an analyst at Digital Commerce Insights, a consultancy focused on e-commerce optimization, you have access to two pivotal datasets: 'Ecommerce Orders' and 'Customer Profiles'. The 'Ecommerce Orders' dataset offers detailed insights into customer orders, including products purchased, quantities, unit prices, order dates, and shipping costs. Meanwhile, the 'Customer Profiles' dataset provides rich information on customer demographics, such as email, country, membership type, and spending history.

In an e-commerce landscape where customer preferences, purchasing behavior, and efficient order fulfillment play crucial roles, your analytical prowess is vital. Your challenge is to dissect these datasets to uncover patterns and insights that could revolutionize e-commerce strategies, improve customer engagement, and drive sales growth.

### **Objective**

Your mission is to utilize Tableau's robust capabilities to craft a compelling narrative from the provided datasets. This task will encompass thorough data preparation, intelligent data modeling, and the skillful application of calculated fields and Tableau functions for sophisticated analysis. The ultimate aim is to construct an interactive and intuitive dashboard in Tableau that showcases your key discoveries, offering concise, actionable insights into the optimization of hotel operations and performance.

The "EcommerceDataset1.xlsx" file contains the following columns:

1. **OrderID**: A unique identifier for each order.
2. **CustomerName**: Name of the customer.
3. **Product**: Type of product ordered.
4. **Quantity**: Quantity of the product ordered.
5. **UnitPrice**: Price per unit of the product.
6. **OrderDate**: Date when the order was placed.
7. **ShippingCost**: Cost of shipping for the order.
8. **CustomerID**: A unique identifier for each customer.  (Primary Key)

The "EcommerceDataset2.xlsx" file contains the following columns:

1. **CustomerID**: A unique identifier for each customer, corresponding to the 'CustomerID' in "EcommerceDataset1.xlsx". (Foreign Key)
2. **CustomerEmail**: Email address of the customer.
3. **Country**: Country of the customer.
4. **Membership**: Membership status of the customer (e.g., Premium, VIP).
5. **SignUpDate**: Date when the customer signed up.
6. **LastOrderDate**: Date of the customer's last order.
7. **TotalSpent**: Total amount spent by the customer.
8. **Customer Communication Log:** Detailed communication logs for each customer.

### **Part 1: Data Cleaning, Modeling, and Advanced Analysis in Tableau**

1. **Data Preparation**
    - Import both datasets into Tableau. Perform a preliminary examination of the data. Identify any data quality issues or inconsistencies.
    - Clean and prepare the data if necessary (e.g., handling missing values, data type conversions).
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers based on their 'TotalSpent' into categories like 'High Spender', 'Medium Spender', 'Low Spender'. Define the thresholds for these categories.
3. **Calculated Field for Profit Margin**: Create a calculated field to estimate the profit margin per order. Assume a fixed percentage margin on the 'UnitPrice'.
4. **Analysis of Membership Types**: Analyze the distribution of orders across different 'Membership' types. Do certain membership types tend to spend more?
5. **Country-Based Analysis**: Compare the average order value and total quantity ordered by customers from different 'Countries'.
6. **Order Frequency Analysis**: Calculate the frequency of orders per customer. Who are the top repeat customers?
7. **Product Popularity Analysis**: Identify the most and least popular products based on the quantity ordered.
8. **Cohort Analysis**: Perform a cohort analysis based on the 'SignUpDate' of customers. How does the spending behavior vary among different cohorts?
9. **Dynamic Date Filters for Order Analysis**: Implement dynamic date filters to analyze order data over different timeframes.
10. **Customer Tenure Calculation**: Calculate the tenure of each customer from their 'SignUpDate' to the current date.
11. **Time-Series Analysis of Orders**: Analyze the trend of orders over time. Are there noticeable seasonal effects or trends?
12. **Aggregate Analysis of Shipping Cost**: Calculate the average shipping cost per product. Are there products with significantly higher shipping costs?
13. **Analysis of Customer Communication Logs**: Use text analysis to identify common themes in the 'Customer Communication Log'. What are the frequent issues or inquiries?
14. **Predictive Analysis for Future Spending**: Use trend lines to predict future spending patterns of customers. How reliable are these predictions?
15. **Product and Membership Correlation**: Investigate if there's a correlation between the types of products purchased and the membership status of customers.
16. **Clustering for Customer Segmentation**: Use clustering to group customers based on spending patterns, order frequency, and membership type.
17. **Advanced Data Calculations for Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Develop a calculated field to estimate the CLV of each customer. Consider factors like order frequency, average order value, and tenure.
18. **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Analyze the 'Customer Communication Log' to gauge customer satisfaction. Correlate this with their spending patterns.
19. **Custom Date Parsing for Order Trends**: Create a custom date parsing calculation to analyze order data by week, month, and quarter.
20. **Market Basket Analysis for Product Combinations**: Conduct a market basket analysis to explore common product combinations bought together.

### **Part 2: Dashboard Building**

1. **Comprehensive Dashboard Creation**
    - Create a comprehensive dashboard in Tableau that includes visuals for total sales, order trends, customer spending patterns, and product popularity. Include filters for country, membership, and product type.
2. **Design and User Experience**
    - Focus on the design and layout of your dashboard. Ensure that it is user-friendly, informative, and visually appealing.
3. **Time Intelligence in Dashboard**
    - Incorporate time intelligence features in your dashboard. Display trends over time, such as monthly or quarterly sales.
4. **Map Visualization for Geographic Analysis**
    - Create a map visualization to show sales distribution by country. Highlight key regions based on sales volume or order frequency.
5. **Interactive Elements: Slicers and Filters**
    - Implement slicers and filters for interactive data exploration. Allow users to filter by date ranges, customer segments, or spending tiers.
6. **Key Insights and Takeaways**
    - Provide a section in your dashboard that summarizes key insights or findings from the data. Highlight trends in customer behavior, product performance, and sales efficiency.
