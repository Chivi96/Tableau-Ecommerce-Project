### **Case Study: Enhancing E-Commerce Strategies through Data Analytics**

### **Background**

As an analyst at Digital Commerce Insights, a consultancy focused on e-commerce optimization, you have access to two pivotal datasets: 'Ecommerce Orders' and 'Customer Profiles'. The 'Ecommerce Orders' dataset offers detailed insights into customer orders, including products purchased, quantities, unit prices, order dates, and shipping costs. Meanwhile, the 'Customer Profiles' dataset provides rich information on customer demographics, such as email, country, membership type, and spending history.

In an e-commerce landscape where customer preferences, purchasing behavior, and efficient order fulfillment play crucial roles, your analytical prowess is vital. Your challenge is to dissect these datasets to uncover patterns and insights that could revolutionize e-commerce strategies, improve customer engagement, and drive sales growth.

### **Objective**

Your mission is to utilize Tableau's robust capabilities to craft a compelling narrative from the provided datasets. This task will encompass thorough data preparation, intelligent data modeling, and the skillful application of calculated fields and Tableau functions for sophisticated analysis. The ultimate aim is to construct an interactive and intuitive dashboard in Tableau that showcases your key discoveries, offering concise, actionable insights into the optimization of hotel operations and performance.
